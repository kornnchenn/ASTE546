Final Project Pseudo Code

Main{
   
    #define Length (1D)
        L = 10 debye lengths in paper

    #define species
        Deuterium 2 AMU
        Tritium 3 AMU
        Neutron
        # don't include Electron?
        Helium4

    #define sources (not closed)
    #add source for each species
        sources.emplace_back(new WarmBeamSource( ))
        sources.emplace_back(new WarmBeamSource( ))

    #set number of each species/ number density
        #In the paper they use 500,000 of each species

    #Inject Initial particles

    #Compute Charge density


    #solve for initial Potential using Potential Solver
        Using FFTW library to use Fouier Transform to solve Poisson's Eq. 
        Update Potential Solver .cpp to include FFTW method

    #obtain electric field


    #inject particles from source

    #move particles
        while advance time one timestep{
            for all species {
                advance particles
                computer number density

        }

        #Look for Collisions
            
            Are they within Rc/2 (Eq 9) ? Evaluate them for a collision

        #Compute Charge density

        #update Potential

        #Calculate electric field

        #updaate averages at steady state?

        #output every 100 steps
